### CPSC 120
*Lab 3 Part 1
Lab 3 part was one of my favorite labs because it taught us how we can use programming to enter information and receive information back. This lab showed us how we can enter information such as our age, height, and weight, and get back how many calories we should be eating a day. This lab was interesting because this code would provide different outcomes for everyone.

*Lab 8 Part 1
Lab 8 part 1 was another favorite of mine. This one was interesting because it showed us how Olympic judging is done. We learned how to take the average of the scores and delete the highest score and the lowest score, which gave us the total score for the athlete. This one was challenging but still fun to complete.

*Lab 4 Part 1
Lab 4 part 1 was a challenging but fun lab to complete. This lab showed us how to complete conversions and it provided us with a code that allowed us to enter a unit amount and convert it for us. This one took some time but once we got the hang of it, it was a fun lab to do.
